Structural Scenario
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The :class:`ScenarioStructural<mphys.scenario_structural.ScenarioStructural>` is for scenarios that only need the structural solver.
An examples use case for this scenario would be a stress constraint from a static load generated by the structural solver subsystem(s).

Default Solvers
===============
The default solvers are NonlinearRunOnce and LinearRunOnce that execute the pre coupling, coupling, and post coupling subsystems in order.
